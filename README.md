# My-Landscaper

## Welcome to My-Landscaper!
My-Landscaper is the capstone project from my time at Flatiron School. This application empowers users to design their dream landscapes and seamlessly communicate their vision to a landscaping company for accurate design, quoting, and installation.

Follow along as I build out the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within three weeks, with ongoing improvements until the project is ready for deployment.
